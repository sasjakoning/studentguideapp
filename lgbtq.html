                The Netherlands is a relatively liberal country as far as sexuality is concerned. Homosexuality, transsexuality and bisexuality are generally accepted. Homosexual marriage is permitted and unmarried couples living together have the same rights as married couples.

                    The Amsterdam Pride event is held from the end of July to the beginning of August each year. This festival allows the lgbtq+ community to show that they are proud to be who they are. They celebrate this with many festivals and parties. The biggest is the Canal Pride, where lots of colourful boats sail through the canals. For more information, see: <a href="https://pride.amsterdam/">www.pride.amsterdam</a>
